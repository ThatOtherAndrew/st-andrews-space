Hello there! If you're here, then you're probably a new student bound to start university this September - if so, welcome! It's great to have you here. :D

Just like you, I'm a new student trying to juggle the vast quantities of uni-related information being constantly bombarded at me from all directions up until the start of term - and I get it, it can be overwhelming! As such, this here is my attempt at collating and centralising some key information, resources, and other useful tidbits of information. Hope you find this useful!
